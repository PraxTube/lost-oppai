{$name}: Hello, stranger.
{$name}: You look like you have had quite a day.
-> Hello, yes sort of.
    {$name}: What are you doing out here? Are you lost?
    -> Yes...

{$name}: Well, then how about I give you a hand?
{$name}: I live around this area.
{$name}: When it's a beatiful sunny day like today, I like to take a stroll.
{$name}: I suppose you aren't taking a leisurely stroll?
-> I am not. I don't remember anything, I just woke up in the middle of the road.
    {$name}: Wait, what?
    {$name}: So you don't even know how you got here?
    {$name}: Where are you from then?
    You: I... I don't remember.
    {$name}: Hm... OH! How rude of me, I didn't even introduce myself yet!
    <<set $name = "Isabelle">>
    {$name}: I am Isabelle, who are you?
    -> I am Pai, nice to meet you.
        {$name}: So you at least remember your name!
        {$name}: It's also nice to meet you, Pai.
        {$name}: Is there anything else you remember besides your name?
        -> No... not really. Only that this feeling of being lost seems familiar.
            {$name}: Huh.
            {$name}: Could it be that you are lost in a more general way in life?
            -> That... may be the case.

{$name}: I see. Well that's nothing bad though.
{$name}: You still seem pretty young.
{$name}: I have met people that changed their lifes for the better when they were way older.
{$name}: It's never to late to change directions.
{$name}: Or to find one in the first place.
{$name}: What are you struggling with the most?
-> Kind of... everything. What does it mean to be happy? That kind.
    {$name}: I see...
    {$name}: Some might tell you that it's following your purpose.
    {$name}: Or that you need to have a dream that you fully commit to.
    {$name}: And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
    {$name}: In fact, it can be very freeing to just commit yourself to something.
    {$name}: For me however, happyness comes from enjoying the little things.
    {$name}: Enjoying what is, not what was or could.
    {$name}: Enjoying the here and now and time spend with others.
    -> I have heard that before. You may say that, but it's something else to actually life like it.
        {$name}: That is true of course.
        {$name}: But it's something I have learned over the years.
        {$name}: To treasure your relationships with others.
        {$name}: Treating the people that are dear to you with the respect and kindness they deserve.
        {$name}: If you give love and kindness, it will come back to you.
        {$name}: You never know how much time you will have left with them.
        {$name}: So you better treasure the moment you have and enjoy what is.
        {$name}: Right?
        -> Hm, I suppose.
            {$name}: You still seem hesitant.
            {$name}: Oh yeah!
            {$name}: How about this then?
            <<jump IsabelleProposal>>
    -> Enjoying your time with others is a good point.
        {$name}: Yes, it's very important to treasure your relationships.
        {$name}: This can be harder then you might think however.
        {$name}: The problem is that people tend to spend too much time with eachother.
        {$name}: Which might streem strange to be an issue at first glance.
        {$name}: The reason for this is that you need distance in every relationship.
        {$name}: Whether with your friends or your lover.
        {$name}: It's important to be alone and spend time with yourself.
        {$name}: Otherwise you get physically and mentally dependent on the other.
        {$name}:

{$name}: You can live with me for a while.
{$name}: My husband and I started a family not too long ago.
{$name}: It's still quite chaotic with the kids, so I could use a helping hand.
{$name}: How about you life with us?
{$name}: You help us out with chores and I will show you how to enjoy the simple life.
-> I don't know, seems very sudden.
    {$name}: Right, of course.
    {$name}: In that case, why don't you talk with some old acquaintances of mine.
    <<target_npc_mentioned {$name} {$target_npc}>>
    {$name}: They are called Ionas and Antonius.
    {$name}: I meet them regularly on my strolls.
    {$name}: The two have differing world views which tends to create interesting conversations.
    {$name}: They are gonna be around here somehwere.
    {$name}: Why don't you talk with them and tell me about your decision after?
    -> Okay, I will give it a try.
        {$name}: Awesome! I will be waiting here for you then.
        {$name}: Safe trip! And don't get lost ^_^

-> I can't find them.
    {$name}: Oh, well they should be around somewhere.
    {$name}: Probably talking about the purpose of life or something similar.
    {$name}: If you stay on the path you are bound to run into him.

{$name}: Oh really? Did you manage to decide?

{$name}: And try to find peace and happiness in living in the moment.

{$name}: Great!
{$name}: What was your final reason to decide to come with me?
-> I think what you said makes sense. I want to try to life more in the moment and appreciate the small things more.
    {$name}: Well said!
    {$name}: In that case, how about we get going?
    -> Let's go *Join Isabelle*
