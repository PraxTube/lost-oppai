Now, a character will talk. Notice how the upper left corner of the dialogue will show their name.
Hohenheim: Hi, I'm Jan Hohenheim, creator of Yarn Spinner for Rust. I hope you enjoy using it!
Let's set a condition. Do you prefer dogs or cats?
-> Dogs
    <<set $animal = "dog">>
-> Cats
    <<set $animal = "cats">>
-> Turtles
    I, uuuh... okay, why not.
    <<set $animal = "turtles">>
Now let's print the result of the condition. Your preference is...
(Drum roll)
<<if $animal == "dog">>
Dogs! Arf Arf!
<<elseif $animal == "cats">>
Cats! (Can't say I agree, but you do you)
<<else>>
Turtles! Solid choice.
<<endif>>
Et voil√†! That was all. Thanks for checking out Yarn Spinner for Rust! Continuing from the last node will exit the dialogue.
